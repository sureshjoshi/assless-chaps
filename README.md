Yes, it's a tautology, but it still sounds funny.

## What is this?

Just a proof-of-concept of the baseline functionality of [scie-pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants), missing several obvious features, with significantly less code.

The goal here is to see if the current `scie-pants` repo could be mostly replaced with a few small Python scripts and pre-packaging Pants as a scie, instead of a pex.
